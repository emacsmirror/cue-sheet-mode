;;; Commentary:

;; Major mode for CUE sheet cue files.
;;
;; The official standard supports only a few keywords but in principle many more
;; are in use through REM. This mode treats both the proper keywords and the
;; ones commonly in use in the wild through REM as regular keywords.
;;
;; This mode was previously called `cue-mode' but that clashes with the mode on
;; MELPA used for the CUE data validation language unrelated to this.
;;
